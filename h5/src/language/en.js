      'Smart contracts are an algorithm in the cryptocurrency blockchain, and in our case, Coinan is the first choice where we can create smart contracts. The main purpose of such contracts is the automation of relationships, giving the opportunity to automate the execution of commitments.',
    problem2: '2. What is DAC?',
    answer2:
      'DAC was created by a group of cryptocurrency enthusiasts who are members of the community without any special privileges. DAC is a string of code built to run automatically on the Cryptocurrency chain ---- The technical term is called smart contract it is the most secure and flexible and reliable kind of code algorithm or computer logic operation built on the blockchain. Cryptocurrency is also one of the first digital currencies in the world to introduce the concept and application of smart contracts on the blockchain. Smart contracts, like cryptocurrencies, are distributed. They work strictly as established and have no possibility of being tampered with. All the logical code of a smart contract is placed on the blockchain and all calculations are performed by millions of computers around the world. This ensures that there is no risk of hacking a smart contract and stopping the project. Because it is stored decentralized on the blockchain.',
    problem3: '3. Who will operate the platform?',
    answer3:
      'There are no administrators in the DAC project. There was a creator who uploaded the contract code to the cryptocurrency blockchain Coinan. Since then, the smart contract has become part of the entire network and is supported by miners. No one has the right to influence, cancel or terminate the operation of a smart contract. Any unauthorized attempts to change it will be rejected due to inconsistency with the previous copy in the blockchain.',
    problem4: '4. How do I lose money when the project crashes?',
    answer4:
      'You will not lose money!Smart contracts are absolutely transparent, and all data is recorded in the blockchain. No fraud or fraud. The project cannot fail. As long as the blockchain exists, it will work, even if the site is closed.',
